                    	<p>Whoever you are and wherever you fit on the Air Force team, the Core Values are what you will live by and learn to cherish.
The Core Values are much more than minimum standards. They remind us what it takes to get the mission done. They inspire us to do our very best at all times. They are the common bond among all comrades in arms, and they are the glue that unifies the Force and ties us to the great warriors and public servants of the past.

                        <h3>INTEGRITY FIRST:</h3>
                        <p>Integrity is a character trait. It is the willingness to do what is right even when no one is looking. It is the moral compass, the inner voice, the voice of self-control and the basis for the trust imperative in today's military.  Integrity is the ability to hold together and properly regulate all of the elements of a personality. A person of integrity, for example, is capable of acting on conviction. A person of integrity can control impulses and appetites</p>
                        
<p>But integrity also covers several other moral traits indispensable to national service: Courage, Honesty, Responsibility, Accountability, Justice, Openness, Self-respect, and Humility.
</p>
                        <h3>SERVICE BEFORE SELF:</h3>
                        <p>An Airman's professional duties always take precedence over personal desires.
At the very least, it includes the following behaviors:
<h4>RULE FOLLOWING</h4>
To serve is to do one's duty, and our duties are most commonly expressed through rules. While it may be the case that professionals are expected to exercise judgment in the performance of their duties, good professionals understand that rules have a reason for being - and the default position must be to follow those rules unless there is a clear, operational reason for refusing to do so.
<h4>RESPECT FOR OTHERS</h4>
Service before self tells us also that a good leader places the troops ahead of his/her personal comfort. We must always act in the certain knowledge that all persons possess a fundamental worth as human beings.
<h4>DISCIPLINE AND SELF-CONTROL</h4>
Professionals cannot indulge themselves in self-pity, discouragement, anger, frustration or defeatism. They have a fundamental moral obligation to the persons they lead to strike a tone of confidence and forward-looking optimism.
</p>
                        
                        <h3>EXCELLENCE IN ALL WE DO:</h3>
                        <p>Every American Airman strives for continual improvement in self and service.
Excellence in all we do directs us to develop a sustained passion for continuous improvement and innovation that will propel the Air Force into a long-term, upward spiral of accomplishment and performance.

					<div class="bucket2_bottom">
                    	<div class="bucket2_details">
    					<p>The roots of the ROTC program reach back more than 150 years, to 1862 when the Morrill Act required the land-grant colleges to offer courses in military training.  After the Civil War, Arkansas applied for land-grant status; and by 1886, colleges in all eleven states of the old Confederacy were also funded under the act.  The Morrill Act contained no specific provisions for a military curriculum.  Each university developed its own course of study.  The program as we know it today is founded on the National Defense Act of 1916. Building on the Morrill Act of 1862, the National Defense Act (NDA) created a formal Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC).  The NDA authorized the President to establish ROTC units not only at land-grant colleges but at all accredited four-year institutions. </p>
                        <p>The years following World War II were a time of reorganization and variation for ROTC.  On 16 September 1947, the United States Air Force was established as a separate and equal element of the United States armed forces.  The fledgling Air Force quickly established its own identity.  A Department of Defense order on         26 September 1947 transferred all units and personnel of the Army Air Forces, including Air ROTC, to the United States Air Force.  Army Air Fields were renamed Air Force Bases and personnel were soon being issued a sassy new uniform. The "brown shoe days," were over.  In December 1947, Headquarters United States Air Force (USAF) announced plans to merge the Air Defense Command and Tactical Air Command to form a super command--the Continental Air Command (ConAC).  This reorganization, completed one year later in December 1948 and intended to strengthen the air defense and close air support missions, placed all tactical fighter resources, including all active, reserve, and guard personnel, under a single commander. Besides its "flying and fighting missions," the Continental Air Command (ConAC) also gained along with Air Defense Command the responsibility for what was now termed Air Force ROTC.</p>
                        <p>When the University of Arkansas officials chose to incorporate Air Force ROTC into the program, Colonel Ray O'Day, who spent forty-one months in a Japanese prisoner of war camp, was named head of the University of Arkansas ROTC military department. The military program, referred to as the Combined Services ROTC Program, included Infantry, Signal, and Air Corps branches until 1949, when the Air Corps became Air Force ROTC. Lieutenant Colonel Merton L. Parks came to the University of Arkansas in 1948 to be the assistant Professor of Military Science and Tactics in charge of the Air Unit.  A year later he became the Professor of Air Science and Tactics when Air Force ROTC achieved equal status with Army ROTC at the University of Arkansas.  Since the establishment of Air Force ROTC, the University of Arkansas, and cross towns at John Brown University, North West Arkansas Community College, and University of Arkansas Fort Smith, have contributed to the education and commissioning of over 890 students.</p>
