                    			                       <p>Air Force ROTC is just like any other college courseâ€”it has its own admissions requirements. And since we offer a wealth of real-world leadership experiences and the opportunity to earn a commission as an Air Force Officer, you will need to meet some additional requirements as you progress from the General Military Course to the Professional Officer Course (POC ). Scholarship applicants and recipients must also meet requirements specific to the scholarship for which they are applying.</p>
                        <h3>4 YEAR PROGRAM</h3>
                        <p>The first two years of the four-year program, the General Military Course, consist one hour of classroom work, two hours of leadership laboratory and three hours physical conditioning each week. After completing the first two years requirements, cadets who wish to compete for entry into the last two years of the program, the Professional Officer Course, must do so under the requirements of the Professional Officer Course selection system. This system uses qualitative factors such as grade-point average, unit commander evaluation, aptitude and physical fitness test scores to determine a student's officer potential. After selection, students must successfully complete a four-week, summer field training unit at Maxwell AFB before entering the course. </p>
                    	<p>In the Professional Officer Course, cadets attend class three hours a week, participate in a two-hour, weekly leadership laboratory and perform three hours of physical conditioning weekly. Cadets apply what they have learned in the general military course and at field training. Cadets conduct the leadership laboratories and manage the unit's cadet corps. Each unit has a cadet corps based on the Air Force organizational pattern of flight, squadron, group and wing. Classes are small, with emphasis on group discussions and cadet presentations. Classroom topics include leadership, communication skills and national defense policy. Once enrolled in the Professional Officer Course, all cadets are enlisted in the Air Force Reserve, assigned to the Obligated Reserve Section.</p>

                    	<div class="bucket2_details">
                        <p>There are three main components that we use to train Air Force ROTC cadets:</p>
                        <h3>AIR SCIENCE (AS) CLASS</h3>
                        <p>Each year of the four-year program has one level of Air Science lecture courses. Typically, the freshman and sophomore courses are one credit hour each while the junior and senior courses are three credit hours each.</p>
                        <h3>LEADERSHIP LABORATORY (LLAB)</h3>
                        <p>Cadets meet once a week for two hours to complete this requirement. The lab is broken into two different levels. During the lab environment, the General Military Course cadets (freshman and sophomores) are trained by the Professional Officer Course cadets (juniors and seniors) on various topics. Those topics include things such as, drill and ceremonies, customs and courtesies, dormitory procedures, small unit tactics, and followership.</p>
                        <p>The Professional Officer Course cadets plan and execute the required training objectives each week, so their piece of the puzzle takes a vast amount of coordination and discipline.</p>
                        <h3>PHYSICAL TRAINING (PT)</h3>
                        <p>Cadets meet two times a week for about an hour to meet this requirement.  Physical training is offered three times a week on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.  We spend this time preparing/training our bodies to meet and exceed physical fitness standards.  Workouts are typically dynamic in nature and can include intense levels of both aerobic and anaerobic workouts. </p>

                            Air Force ROTC prepares you to become an Air Force Officer, which carries a high level of responsibility, accountability and professionalism. You have to be dedicated. You must be committed. The payoff? If you can make it in Air Force ROTC and the Air Force, you can make it anywhere in life. </p>
                            <p>
The education, leadership and management experience that you will gain in your field of choice, combined with a degree, is sure to prepare you for a promising future in either the Air Force or the business world. And when you graduate from ROTC, you will dive right into a management-level position within the Air Force, well ahead of your non-ROTC college peers. </p>
